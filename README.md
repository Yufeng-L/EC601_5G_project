## Introduction
Mobile communications has brought about profound changes in people's lives. In order to cope with a burst of traffic growth in 2020, the industry is witnessing the arrival of massive device connections, and emerging new services and scenarios, and celebrating the fifth generation of mobile communications. 

Massive MIMO is one of the most important 5G technologies. It will significantly change the traditional network planning, which is based on sector-level wide beams. The antenna pattern of MassiveMIMOisnolongerasector-levelfixedwidebeam,buthas been replaced with user-centric dynamic narrow beams instead. The shape of massive MIMO antenna is always a huge rectangular box.The face is that 5G Utility base station requires much larger space compared with 3G/4G base stations which has required measurement and evaluation towards now exsting poles. However, manually evaluating is time consuming and costly. Telecom compamy need a high-efficient way for pole evaluation.

This project is going use Google Street Imagery to model every utiltiy pole in a neighborhood and find a match to install certain equipment. Machine learning & Computer Visions will help us analyze the photos of utility poles and finally display results on web application.

## Product Definition
### __Product Mission__
For Telecom Company to determine where to install the 5G equipments on utility poles.

### __Target User(s)__
Target users are the Telecom Companies.
### __User Stories__
- I, the user, should be able to indentify if a specific utility pole has enough space to install the 5G equipment.
- I, the user, should be able to see the qualified utility poles on a specific area.

### __MVP(Minimum viable product)__
5G is the fifth generation cellular network technology. In this project, the most important mission is to determine if a specific utility pole has space to install the 5G equipment, and the next step is consider the distribution of installations.
